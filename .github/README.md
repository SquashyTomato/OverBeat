# OverBeat

A Custom osu! Tournament Stream Manager.

---

OverBeat is a custom osu! Tournament Overlay designed to replace the osu!lazer Client in exchange for a more custom experience.

This project is designed to serve the overlays itself and work with [tosu](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu) to provide data from the osu! Client(s).

Primarily this was built for UKCT, however custom overlays are planned to be supported.
